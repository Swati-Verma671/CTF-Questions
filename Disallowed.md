Author: [Swati](https://github.com/Swati-Verma671)

## Description

This is a relatively simple challenge which requires the player to have a basic knowledge on robots.txt file and what role they play in the websites.

```
Can you find the flag?

```

## Exploit

The player would get the first hint by visiting the website which says "Do you know what robots.txt is?". With this you will have to visit the robots.txt page of the website where you will see that 007.html is disallowed. The player would then visit 007.html page to find the flag hidden in the page sources.

<br />

The last line should be the flag.
<br />

The flag is:

```
wtfCTF{r0b0ts_N0t_4ll0w3d}
```
